## Assignment: Literature Critique

In this assignment you are going to be reading and critiquing two research articles studying the association between mercury exposure and autism risk. Below is a reading guide with a set of questions that you should address in your write-up. These questions concern topics that we have covered so far in class: data quality, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling. You will be graded on organization, clarity of writing, thoughtfulness with which you answer the questions, and accuracy with which you use concepts from class. Other than that there is no prescribed style or format for the write-up.

### Prenatal and Infant Exposure to Thimerosal From Vaccines and Immunoglobulins and Risk of Autism

- **Research question**
    - What specifically was the research question?
    - How does this question relate to what has already been done in the literature?
- **Data source**
    - Can we look into the structure of the Vaccine Safety Datalink to determine why the 3 MCOs were chosen and if this was a good choice?
- **Study design**
    - Why is it important to specify the protocol for data collection and analysis before the study begins?
    - Why is a matched case control design useful?
    - The control to case ratio was targeted to be 3 to 1. What are the pros and cons of having multiple controls for each case as opposed to just one control per case?
- **Study subjects**
    - Are the inclusion and exclusion criteria reasonable?
    - Based on these criteria, to what population do you think the results would generalize, if any?
    - Of the original population, what portion ended up participating? Should we be worried about non-participation?
- **Outcomes**
    - How was case status ascertained? Why is it important that the assessors were blinded?
    - How was control status ascertained?
    - Why did the authors look at three different autism-related outcomes?
- **Predictors**
    - How were prenatal and postnatal ethylmercury exposure ascertained?
    - What are the pros and cons of defining prenatal and postnatal exposures as the authors did?
    - What other covariates were considered for adjustment in the statistical models? Are these reasonable? How well were they ascertained?
    - Are there other highly important ones that could have been left out?
- **Statistical analysis**
    - Why was conditional logistic regression used as opposed to ordinary logistic regression?
    - "Models were fit with and without covariates." What does this mean and why was this done?
    - What is the reasoning behind the "change-in-estimate" criterion used to choose which covariates were included in the final model?
    - What does it mean for tests to be 2-tailed and for statistical significance to be set at P < 0.05?
    - Why were odds ratios presented in two forms?
    - What is meant by "posthoc calculations indicate that the study had ~80% power to detect ORs of..."?
    - The authors tested interaction terms in their models. What is the purpose of using interaction terms?
    - Were any sensitivity analyses performed?
- **Results and conclusions**
    - What are the authors' findings regarding an association between mercury exposure and autism-related disorders?
    - How do the numbers in the article's tables support those findings?
    - What limitations and potential biases do the authors cite regarding their study?

### Thimerosal exposure in infants and neurodevelopmental disorders: An assessment of computerized medical records in the Vaccine Safety Datalink

- **Research question**
    - What specifically was the research question?
    - How does this question relate to what has already been done in the literature?
- **Data source**
    - Is the Vaccine Safety Datalink a comprehensive and accurate data source?
- **Study design**
    - Why is it important to specify the protocol for data collection and analysis before the study begins?
    - Why did the authors use an ecological study design as opposed to using individual level data? How does this impact the utility of the results?
- **Study subjects**
    - Why did the authors use a cutoff for birth date? Why did they only look at individuals who had the oral polio vaccine? Are the inclusion criteria regarding these two points reasonable?
    - Based on these criteria, to what population do you think the results would generalize, if any?
- **Outcomes**
    - Why did the authors look at neurodevelopmental disorders and control disorders?
    - How was case/control status ascertained?
    - Why did the authors make adjustments for case counts in 1995 and 1996? Is this reasonable?
- **Predictors**
    - How were mercury exposures from the different vaccines ascertained?
    - What other covariates were considered for adjustment in the statistical models?
- **Statistical analysis**
    - Why was Poisson regression used? How many data points ended up being used to fit this model?
    - What does it mean for tests to be 2-tailed and for statistical significance to be set at P < 0.05?
    - Were any sensitivity analyses performed?
- **Results and conclusions**
    - What are the authors' findings regarding an association between mercury exposure and autism-related disorders?
    - How do the numbers in the article's tables support those findings?
    - What limitations and potential biases do the authors cite regarding their study?
