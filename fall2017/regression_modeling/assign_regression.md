## Assignment: Literature Critique

Please submit a PDF or Word document containing your write-up by Saturday, 9/30 at 9:00PM.

In this assignment you are going to be reading and critiquing a research article studying the association between mercury exposure and autism risk (Prenatal and Infant Exposure to Thimerosal From Vaccines and Immunoglobulins and Risk of Autism). Below is a reading guide with some specific points that you should address in your write-up. These questions concern topics that we have covered so far in class: data quality, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling. You will be graded on organization, clarity of writing, thoughtfulness with which you answer the questions, and accuracy with which you use concepts from class. Other than that there is no prescribed style or format for the write-up.

- **Research question and data collection**
    - Think back to our discussion of the who, what, when, where, why, and how of data collection and comment on the authors' steps in this regard.
- **Study design**
    - Why is it important to specify the protocol for data collection and analysis before the study begins?
    - Why is a matched case control design useful?
    - The control to case ratio was targeted to be 3 to 1. What are the pros and cons of having multiple controls for each case as opposed to just one control per case?
- **Statistical analysis**
    - Why was conditional logistic regression used as opposed to ordinary logistic regression?
    - "Models were fit with and without covariates." What does this mean and why was this done?
    - What is the reasoning behind the "change-in-estimate" criterion used to choose which covariates were included in the final model? Comment on other methods for doing this.
    - What does it mean for tests to be 2-tailed and for statistical significance to be set at P < 0.05?
    - Why were odds ratios presented in two forms?
    - What is meant by "posthoc calculations indicate that the study had ~80% power to detect ORs of..."?
    - The authors tested interaction terms in their models. What is the purpose of using interaction terms?
    - Were any sensitivity analyses performed?
    - Thinking about other types of regression we discussed in class, what other types of outcomes could have been used to study the association between mercury exposure and autism risk and what types of regression would be appropriate for those?
- **Results and conclusions**
    - Discuss the authors' findings, the study's strengths and limitations, and your overall impressions based on your critique of the other aspects above.
