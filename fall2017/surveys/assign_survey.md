# Assignment: Survey Sampling

For this assignment, you will work as a class to come up with a short plan for the design of a survey. In the survey, you are aiming to determine if the Public Health department is meeting the needs of its students. What specifically "meeting the needs" means is up to you.

Specifically, one person should submit a document that includes:

- The survey instrument with up to 5 items. You should explain your rationale for structuring the items as you did.
- The sampling frame to be used with a description of what is contained in it.
- The sampling plan to be used
- The mode of delivery of the survey
- The analysis plan

Everyone in the class should submit a short paragraph describing their own contributions to the plan as well as the contributions of classmates. Everyone in the class will receive the same base grade, but I will use this information to adjust individual grades if necessary.
