## Assignment: Hypothesis Testing

Please submit a PDF or Word document containing responses to these questions by Saturday, 9/23 at 9:00PM.

1. What are three factors that inflence statistical power and why? Use plots and output from our in-class activity to support your explanation. Be sure to appropriately use statistical terms related to hypothesis testing.

2. During a conversation, a colleague says, "That diabetes study in Nature reported 85% power to detect a reasonable difference between glucose levels in the two drug groups. Their results were statistically significant, so I'm pretty sure that the new drug works." What would be your response to him? Use plots and output from our in-class activity to support your explanation.

3. The conventional type I error rate used for scientific studies is 0.05. Explain why lowering this error rate can be viewed as a more stringent criterion for assessing differences. What happens to the corresponding test statistic thresholds, p-value thresholds, and confidence interval widths when the type I error rate is raised and lowered?

4. Make some general conclusions from the confidence interval investigation from our in-class activity. When does the Wilson score interval preferable to the normal approximation interval? Use plots and output from our in-class activity to support your explanation. While the investigation focused on confidence intervals for proportions, let's think about these ideas more generally. For some estimate of interest, say a mean, what is the point of creating different methods for creating confidence intervals? Say that a statistician has developed such a new method. How might she go about evaluating her new method?

5. A teacher colleague of yours says that he wants to compare the test scores for two of his calculus sections where he used one type of review material for section 1 and another type for section 2. He tells you that he plans to compare the scores using a one-sided t-test because he feels that his material for section 1 is superior to that for section 2. What would you say to him?

6. Read the following [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochran%E2%80%93Mantel%E2%80%93Haenszel_statistics) on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Explain what this test is used for in your own words, using a specific public health example.

7. Look at table 1 of the "Zika Virus Infection in Pregnant Women in Rio de Janeiro" article available on Blackboard. Explain what information is being displayed in the table. What are your impressions of the results displayed? Comment in the context of the scientific question of interest.

8. You are a statistical consultant and a client comes into clinic saying, "An analysis in my study is to compare menstrual cycle lengths in two groups of women. My boss said something about using an alpha level of 0.05 and a Wilcoxon rank sum test? What does that even mean? Honestly, I'm really confused about all of this. Can you help me understand what I'm supposed to do?" Write a response that details what your advice to her would be. Be sure to indicate what additional information you would ask of her, if appropriate. Also be sure to explain relevant hypothesis testing ideas to her to give some context for your recommendation.

9. Discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of the hypothesis testing framework. Use examples from any of our readings and/or your experiences.
