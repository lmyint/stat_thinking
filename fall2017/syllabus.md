## Course Description

Much of the science that we are exposed to on a daily basis is not through original research articles but through sources such as news reports, articles from content aggregators, and social media postings. While these convenient sources of information can be useful in some respects, it is important to read the original scientific articles on which these reports are based. Only in this way can we better understand the state of science on the issues we care about. In this course, students will primarily learn about statistical concepts within the domains of association studies, causal inference, survey analysis, and survival analysis that provide the background necessary to read a wide variety of primary research in public health. Required readings from a custom course textbook will be supplemented by in-class lecture, discussion, and guided simulation exercises. Simulation exercises will use the Shiny environment in the R programming language which allows for point-and-click style exploration and does not require any coding. All code used to create these simulation activities will be made available so that students familiar with R or who want to learn more have the chance to explore on their own time. Secondary goals of the class include (1) examining the differences between information contained in original research articles and secondary sources and (2) improving written and oral communication about statistical ideas.

## Course Learning Objectives

Upon successfully completing this course, students will be able to:

1.  Critically evaluate reporting on studies in major fields of
    statistics including association studies, causal inference,
    surveys, and survival analysis.

2.  Understand the logistical and statistical considerations required
    for the design and analysis of such studies.

3.  Develop reasonable plans for the design and analysis of such studies.

4.  Analyze how such considerations are addressed in original research
    and how this information is conveyed in news reports.

5.  Compare the strengths and limitations of particular study designs
    and analysis approaches for answering a research question and for
    making statements about causality.

6.  Communicate more effectively about their evaluations of news, both
    orally and through writing.

7.  Apply field-specific terminology to convey ideas about such studies
    and their reporting in the news.

8.  Clearly communicate informed evaluations about a particular body of
    news.

## Grading

**Class participation - 10%**

Students are expected to actively pay attention and to participate 
in class by asking questions, answering questions, and contributing 
to discussions. I will be making note of participation and post 
participation grades approximately every two weeks.

**Weekly journal: Synthesis of class topics – 70%**

Students will keep a journal of responses to the required readings, 
lectures, and discussion material. For each module, students will be 
given a document containing required pre-class readings and questions 
to answer before and/or after each class. These questions are intended 
to focus students' attention on the readings and to clearly express 
ideas discussed in class.

Responses will be graded weekly on content, clarity of writing, and
appropriate use of statistics and terminology.

**Final project: News topic synthesis – 20%**

Students will choose a news subject that interests them (preferably
related to public health topics but others may be suitable—see
instructor) and perform a comprehensive review and evaluation of news
reporting on this subject. Requirements for the project include the
following:

1.  Collection of at least ten news articles on the chosen subject and
    three primary research papers cited by or directly related to the
    content of those articles. Of the three research papers, at most 
    one can be a systematic review/meta-analysis. If you choose to read 
    more than three research papers, the additional ones can include any 
    number of systematic reviews/meta-analyses.

2.  Summary of content in the news articles and primary research papers

3.  Critical evaluation of the news articles and primary research papers

4.  Proposed data analysis: students should locate where data related to
    the topic can be found, summarize the features of the available
    data, formulate a research question, propose an analysis plan to
    answer that question, and defend this plan. Students do not actually
    have to perform the analysis.

5.  In-class presentation (approximately 10 minutes) giving a brief overview
    of the subject area, news article coverage, primary research findings, 
    and proposed data analysis (items 2-4).

6.  Written report on items 2-4

Throughout the semester, you will be required to turn in a document showing 
how you have met certain milestones. These will form a small portion of the 
final project grade.

Milestone 1: Choose topic. Find 4 news articles and 1 primary research paper. 
Write a short summary of the news articles and research paper.

Milestone 2: Find at least 6 more news articles and 1 more primary research 
paper. Write a short summary of the new material. Find and briefly discuss a 
source of data on your topic.

Milestone 3: Find the last research paper and begin planning your proposed 
data analysis. Write a short summary of the paper and outline your data 
analysis plan.

## Late assignments

For each day late that an assignment is submitted, 10% of the total points 
for that assignment will be deducted. Because a lot of class activity depends 
on doing the readings and thinking about them with your journal entries, it 
is important to get assignments in on time.

## Attendance Policies

Because participation is tracked, excess absences will detract from 
your participation grade unless you provide documentation for illness 
or extenuating circumstances. A maximum of three free absences (unexcused 
absences for any reason) will be allowed for the semester. Beyond that point, 
points will be deducted from your participation grade.

## Electronics

Laptops will be permitted during class in order to take notes, reference 
the articles being discussed, and to perform in-class simulation activities.

## Exams

There will be no midterm or final examinations. The final project paper 
will be due at the end of our final exam slot: Wednesday, May 17 at 5PM.

## Academic Integrity

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. 
In this course, you must be honest and truthful. Ethical violations include 
cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments, improper use of the 
Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of 
graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic 
dishonesty, and unfair competition.

Report any violations you witness to the instructor. You may consult the 
associate dean of student affairs and/or the chairman of the Ethics Board 
beforehand. See the guide on “Academic Ethics for Undergraduates” and the 
[Ethics Board Web site](http://e-catalog.jhu.edu/undergrad-students/student-life-policies/#UAEB) 
for more information.
