## Assignment: Causal Inference

Please submit a PDF or Word document containing your write-up by Saturday, 10/21 at 9:00PM.

For this module, Thursday classes will be heavily participation and discussion based. You will be helping yourselves and your peers understand these concepts by preparing explanations for select concepts. Because of this preparation and the importance of class participation for helping your fellow classmates, part of the grade for this assignment will be based on your participation in Thursday classes.

### Week 1: Foundational ideas in causal inference

Find one news article in which the topic is of causal interest, and give a brief summary of the article. Next, describe how it can be fit into the Rubin causal model. Specifically describe the following:

1. Treatment
2. Units
3. Potential outcomes
4. Assignment mechanism
5. Two components of SUTVA

How does thinking about these items help in the process of study design?

For the particular application in the news article, which of the matching methods discussed could be used to assess causal effects? (Pick one.) How would you implement it? Why did you choose that one?

To prepare for Thursday: Find a news article and read it. Type up responses for the parts indicated in the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vCwTf3Xmf-TTnSBb-BHNUUmzcrj6HNecpsKdsxusIaw/edit?usp=sharing).

### Week 2: Propensity scores and interrupted time series

You will be reading the following two papers (available on Blackboard):

- Propensity score matching: [Effect of Full-Service Partnerships on Homelessness, Use and Costs of Mental Health Services, and Quality of Life Among Adults With Serious Mental Illness](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/210805)
- Interrupted time series: [Evaluating the Impact of Floridaâ€™s "Stand Your Ground" Self-defense Law on Homicide and Suicide by Firearm](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2582988)

Your writing assignment will be to explain what is being done in the statisical methods sections and to evaluate the appropriate use of propensity score and interrupted time series methodology. There are specific points regarding these two methodologies that you should address. You will be helping each other understand these points by each focusing on specific points and explaining them to your peers in class on Thursday. Specifically your written assignment should include:

- Scientific context/question being examined
- Explanation of the causal inference and statistical concepts
- Evaluation of the appropriateness of the authors' approach
- Evaluation of the authors' conclusions in light of data quality and their analysis methods

To prepare for Thursday: For these two articles, read enough of the abstract and/or introduction to understand what is being investigated. Focus on the sections where the statistical methods are being described. Type up explanations to share with your peers for your assigned topics indicated in the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vCwTf3Xmf-TTnSBb-BHNUUmzcrj6HNecpsKdsxusIaw/edit?usp=sharing).

### Week 3: Randomized trials and instrumental variables methods

You will be reading the following two papers (available on Blackboard):

- Randomized trial: [The Oregon Experiment - Effects of Medicaid on Clinical Outcomes](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMsa1212321)
- Instrumental variables: [Evaluating short-term drug effects using a physician-specific prescribing preference as an instrumental variable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16617275)

Your writing assignment will be to explain what is being done in the statisical methods sections and to evaluate the appropriate use of propensity score and interrupted time series methodology. There are specific points regarding these two methodologies that you should address. You will be helping each other understand these points by each focusing on specific points and explaining them to your peers in class on Thursday. Specifically your written assignment should include:

- Scientific context/question being examined
- Explanation of the causal inference and statistical concepts
- Evaluation of the appropriateness of the authors' approach
- Evaluation of the authors' conclusions in light of data quality and their analysis methods

To prepare for Thursday: For these two articles, read enough of the abstract and/or introduction to understand what is being investigated. Focus on the sections where the statistical methods are being described. Type up explanations to share with your peers for your assigned topics indicated in the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vCwTf3Xmf-TTnSBb-BHNUUmzcrj6HNecpsKdsxusIaw/edit?usp=sharing).
