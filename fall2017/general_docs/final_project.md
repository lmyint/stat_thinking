# Final project

For this project, you will be working in groups of 3 to dig more deeply into a scientific area that is of interest to you. Groups will be reading and evaluating a collection of news and primary research articles, similar to what we have been doing in class.

## Topics

Topics should relate to some public health issue of common interest to group members. If you need some ideas for topics, take a look at a [2015 Pew Research report](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/) that surveys scientists and general society on various controversial topics.

**Please confirm your groups and topics with me by the end of class on Tuesday, October 31.**

## Reading required

- 5 news articles
    - These should span the breadth of typical media coverage of this topic.
- 3 primary research articles
    - Across these 3 articles:
        a. One of the following causal inference topics should be covered: matching, propensity scores, interrupted time series, regression discontinuity, randomized trial, instrumental variables.
        b. Survey analysis concepts should be covered
        c. Survival analysis concepts should be covered
    - It is possible that one research article covers multiple of the above topics (a,b,c). This is fine.
    - At most one of these 3 articles can be a review article.

In the news articles, pay attention to:

- What ideas/aspects of the issue tend to be presented? How? Why?
- What information tends to be lacking? Why?
- What ideas would be easy to miss without statistical knowledge?

In the research articles, pay attention to the statistical concepts from the different modules that we have been emphasizing in class and how these studies contribute to the body of knowledge on your topic. What can we learn from these studies, and how does this information fit together to form our general understanding of the issue?

**Please confirm your article choices with me by the end of class on Tuesday, November 14.**

## Presentation

During the last week of class, groups will present their findings in the form of a discussion-centered lesson. One group will present on Tuesday and the other on Thursday. Engaging the class in discussion is part of the final project grade. Specifically, your group should do the following:

- Pick out one primary research article for the class to read thoroughly before your presentation
    - Prepare a guided set of questions for the class to think about when reading this article. This will prepare them for in-class discussion or activities on the day of your presentation.
- Prepare a short document (likely about 1 page) summarizing key ideas from the news and other research articles for the class to read before your presentation
    - Prepare a guided set of questions for the class to think about when reading this document. This will prepare them for in-class discussion or activities on the day of your presentation.
    - This document should contain links and references to all of the news articles and research articles at the end.

Your presentation should **not** be a written critique in slide form. You may use slides or whatever medium your group prefers, but groups should structure their presentation to engage the class. This is emphasized in the above requirements by preparing materials for the class to be ready for discussion.

I am happy to look over your materials beforehand or talk with you about how you plan to actively engage the class during your presentation.

## Grading rubric: 150 points total

### Reading requirements: 20 points

- Find and read 5 news articles: 5 points
- Find and read 3 primary research articles: 15 points

### Presentation - Statistical and scientific issues: 80 points

Based on the materials you prepare for your classmates beforehand, and based on how you run the discussion, I will be able to evaluate your group on the following:

- Data collection and quality ideas: 20 points
    - Group demonstrates careful consideration of data collection and quality issues that could affect study results
- Causal inference concepts: 20 points
    - Group demonstrates understanding of and shows evaluation of statistical and study design concepts
- Survey analysis concepts: 20 points
    - Group demonstrates understanding of and shows evaluation of statistical and study design concepts
- Survival analysis concepts: 20 points
    - Group demonstrates understanding of and shows evaluation of statistical and study design concepts

I am only going to read the materials you provide, but I and other classmates may ask clarifying questions during the presentation. Your group should be prepared to answer such questions. I am happy to let your group know what questions come to mind when I read your materials. The following scale will be used for statistical understanding (gradations between categories are possible):

- 20 points: Group demonstrates adequate handling of most ideas for this area that came up during discussion
- 15 points: Group demonstrates adequate handling of some ideas for this area that came up during discussion
- 10 points: Group demonstrates adequate handling of few ideas for this area that came up during discussion
- 5 points: Group demonstrates adequate handling of nearly zero ideas for this area that came up during discussion

"Adequate handling" means that, based on what we have learned in class, you provide a reasonable answer. I will not make difficult questions count against you. Above all, I want the class to engage in a fruitful discussion, bringing up whatever comes to mind. To that end, my aim is not to ask groups really tough questions. I just want us to think carefully about an area and be able to discuss statistical issues meaningfully, which means that groups should have a solid understanding of what we have covered in class.

### Presentation - Class engagement: 50 points

- Materials provided before the presentation: 30 points
    - Primary research article & guided questions: 15 points
    - Short document on other articles, guided questions, references: 15 points
- Facilitation of class engagement throughout the presentation: 20 points
