## Course Description

Much of the science that we are exposed to on a daily basis is not through original research articles but through sources such as news reports, articles from content aggregators, and social media postings. While these convenient sources of information can be useful in some respects, it is important to read the original scientific articles on which these reports are based. Only in this way can we better understand the state of science on the issues we care about. In this course, students will primarily learn about statistical concepts within the domains of association studies, causal inference, survey analysis, and survival analysis that provide the background necessary to read a wide variety of primary research in public health. Required readings from a custom course textbook will be supplemented by in-class lecture, discussion, and guided simulation exercises. Simulation exercises will use the Shiny environment in the R programming language which allows for point-and-click style exploration and does not require any coding. All code used to create these simulation activities will be made available so that students familiar with R or who want to learn more have the chance to explore on their own time. Secondary goals of the class include (1) examining the differences between information contained in original research articles and secondary sources and (2) improving written and oral communication about statistical ideas.

## Course Learning Objectives

Upon successfully completing this course, students will be able to:

1.  Critically evaluate scientific research articles in major areas of
    statistics including association studies, causal inference, surveys, 
    survival analysis, and longitudinal data analysis.

2.  Understand the logistical and statistical considerations required
    for the design and analysis of such studies.

3.  Develop reasonable plans for the design and analysis of such studies.

4.  Analyze how such considerations are addressed in original research
    and how this information is conveyed in news reports.

5.  Compare the strengths and limitations of particular study designs
    and analysis approaches for answering a research question and for
    making statements about causality.

6.  Communicate more effectively about their evaluations of news, both
    orally and through writing.

7.  Apply field-specific terminology to convey ideas about such studies
    and their reporting in the news.

8.  Clearly communicate informed evaluations about a particular broad
    scientific topic through the final project.

## Textbook

There is a custom textbook for this class that serves as both pre-class 
reading and reference material. The textbook contains small highlighted 
sections containing reflection questions that students should think about 
before coming to class to be prepared for discussion.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into modules ranging from 1 to 3 weeks. Each module 
focuses on a particular statistical area and will be associated with a 
mix of textbook reading, lecture material, news article discussion, research 
article discussion, and in-class interactive explorations of concepts using 
point-and-click applications. The modules covered are as follows:

1. Hypothesis testing
2. Regression modeling
3. Causal inference
4. Survey analysis
5. Survival analysis
6. Longitudinal data analysis

Most modules will have one associated assignment to be turned in for grading. 
More information on these assignments is given in the following section.

## Grading

**Class participation - 10%**

Students are expected to actively pay attention and to participate 
in class by asking questions, answering questions, and contributing 
to discussions. I will be making note of participation and post 
participation grades approximately every two weeks.

**Module assignments – 70%**

Each module (except module 6) will have one assignment. These assignments 
will vary between answering questions related to content covered and 
activities explore in class, critiquing research articles, and 
proposing/defending a study design to answer scientific questions.

Assignments will be graded on content, clarity of writing, appropriate 
use of statistical concepts and terminology, and thoughtful evaluation 
of data quality issues.

**Final project: Scientific topic synthesis – 20%**

Students will work in teams of up to 4, depending on class size. Teams 
will perform a detailed investigation into the state of knowledge 
regarding a broad scientific topic. Students can come up with this topic 
on their own or choose from topics in a 2015 [Pew Research Center report](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/).
Teams will be required to read and evaluate a collection of news articles 
and primary research articles. Teams will give presentations during the 
last week of class. More information will be given in a separate document.

## Late assignments

For every 24 hours late that an assignment is submitted, 10% of the total 
points for that assignment will be deducted.

## Attendance Policies

Because participation is tracked, excess absences will detract from 
your participation grade unless you provide documentation for illness 
or extenuating circumstances. A maximum of three free absences (unexcused 
absences for any reason) will be allowed for the semester. Beyond that point, 
points will be deducted from your participation grade.

## Electronics

Laptops will be permitted during class in order to take notes, reference 
the articles being discussed, and to perform in-class simulation activities. 
Please do not abuse this privilege by frequently using laptops for activities 
not related to what we are doing in class.

## Exams

There will be no midterm or final examinations. Final project presentations 
will take place during the last week of class.

## Academic Integrity

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. 
In this course, you must be honest and truthful. Ethical violations include 
cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments, improper use of the 
Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of 
graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic 
dishonesty, and unfair competition.

Report any violations you witness to the instructor. You may consult the 
associate dean of student affairs and/or the chairman of the Ethics Board 
beforehand. See the guide on “Academic Ethics for Undergraduates” and the 
[Ethics Board Web site](http://e-catalog.jhu.edu/undergrad-students/student-life-policies/#UAEB) 
for more information.
