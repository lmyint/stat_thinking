# Module: Survey Analysis

## Class 1

### Pre-class assignment

Read the following two articles that report on a study that surveyed adults in the United States on their willingness to particpate in the [Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/allofus-research-program).

1. [NIH: Survey shows broad support for national precision medicine study](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/survey-shows-broad-support-national-precision-medicine-study)
2. [Politico: Survey says: yay precision medicine!](http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-ehealth/2016/08/survey-says-yay-precision-medicine-focus-on-cybersecurity-and-privacy-first-of-its-kind-study-from-va-to-commence-215951)

Also look at the documents and survey questions that the study investigators used in the actual implementation of the survey (on Blackboard):

1. Supporting Information 1: Text used to describe the PMI cohort study in the survey
2. Supporting Information 2: Survey questions
3. Supporting Information 3: Text used to describe informed consent scenarios

Provide brief answers to the following questions on Blackboard:

1. What is your overall impression of how US adults seem to be viewing this Precision Medicine Initiative cohort study? Are there things we should be optimistic about or worry about?
2. In supporting information 1, list pros and cons of the wording of the study description.
3. In supporting information 2, list general pros and cons of the design of the survey questions. No need to do this for every survey question, but comment on the general structure and patterns surrounding question design.
4. In supporting information 3, comment on how the different informed consent wordings might affect the estimated proportion of adults willing to participate in the PMI cohort study as measured by the survey. What do you expect regarding differences in characteristics of people who would be willing to participate under these different consent situations?

## Class 2

### Pre-class assignment

Read the following [original research article](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160461) (also available on Blackboard) on a survey of US adults' opinions about the Precision Medicine Initiative's planned national cohort study. You will be divided into groups to present key material from different sections of the paper.

- Group 1: survey methods and analysis methods
- Group 2: results
- Group 3: discussion and limitations

## Journal assignment: end of module

Perform a thorough evaluation of the [PLoS research article](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160461) on the Precision Medicine Initiative survey. Keeping in mind the goals of the survey, evaluate the design of the survey (including questionnaire design, informational material design, sampling plan), the results, and the conclusions.

Also answer these related questions:

1. Suppose the main objective of the survey was to very accurately estimate the proportion of US adults that would actually participate in the Precision Medicine Initiative cohort study. With the data that was collected in the survey, what could be done to estimate this more accurately than they did? What changes to the survey design would have helped this?
2. Propose a multi-stage sampling plan for this study. What units would you sample at each stage? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a sampling plan as compared to what was actually done?
