# Module 1: Association studies

- What are some things that you should think about when evaluating the research question posed in a study? Provide examples from studies that we have read.
- What are some things that you should think about when evaluating the data sources used in a study? Provide examples from studies that we have read. How do these ideas relate to internal and external validity and why are the latter two important?
- What is "p-hacking" and how can we can avoid it?
- Be able to explain hypothesis testing
    - Draw and label the two by two table of outcomes in hypothesis testing. Define and explain the importance of the associated cell probabilities.
    - Understand the relationship between type I error, test statistic threshold, and p-value thresholds.
    - What is meant by "significance was set at alpha = 0.05"?
    - If I increase/decrease my allowable type I error rate, what happens to the test statistic threshold, the p-value threshold, and the width of the confidence interval?
    - What is a two-tailed test? What is the difference between a two-tailed and one-tailed test in terms of the test statistic threshold and p-value threshold? When would we use a one-tailed test versus a two-tailed test?
    - What is statistical power and why is it important? What information is needed to calculate it? Provide examples from our readings for when this was and wasn't used.
- What is conditional logistic regression and when would we use it instead of ordinary logistic regression?
- What is the use of providing both adjusted and unadjusted regression results?
- What is Poisson regression and in what situations is it used?
- Variable selection is a process by which investigators choose which covariates to include in a statistical model. Describe how this was used in the "Prenatal and Infant Exposure to Thimerosal From Vaccines and Immunoglobulins and Risk of Autism" paper. Can you think of another possible variable selection procedure?
- What is imputation? When is it used?
- What is extrapolation?
- What is the interpretation of a confidence interval? What is meant by the term "coverage probability"? Using this term, explain why there exist different methods for calculating confidence intervals. Use an example from the JAMA article on Zika.
- What is Fisher's exact test and when is it used?
- What happens when certain regression assumptions are violated? (See review in Course Content > Module 1 > Class materials > Lecture slides > Review: association studies)
    - Important variables omitted
    - Non-constant variance of error terms
    - Measurement error in predictors
    - Observations are not independent

# Module 2: Causal inference

- What are the components of the Rubin causal model?
- What are examples of well-defined treatments that would be studied in causal inference?
- Define ATE and ATT.
- Explain the two components of SUTVA and how this is important for treatment effect estimation.
- What is the fundamental problem of causal inference?
- What is unconfounded treatment assignment? Explain the importance of this for estimating treatment effects.
- Why do we want to perform randomized trials to estimate treatment effects? Comment on threats to internal and external validity in randomized trials. Explain how RCTs estimate the counterfactual outcomes, and explain the associated assumptions.
- Explain the pros and cons of different randomization strategies: Bernoulli, complete randomization, stratified block randomization
- What are interrupted time series and regression discontinuity designs? Explain how these studies estimate the counterfactual outcomes, and explain the associated assumptions.
- Describe what is being done in matching studies to estimate treatment effects. Explain how these studies estimate the counterfactual outcomes, and explain the associated assumptions.
- What is a propensity score? How are they typically estimated? Explain how propensity scores can be used for matching, subclassification, and weighting to estimate treatment effects.
- What is the idea behind instrumental variable study designs? What is the name of the method that is typically used to estimate treatment effects in these studies, and what is the big picture of what it is trying to do? What assumptions must we make about the instrument?
- Explain how the Bradford-Hill criteria provide ways to evaluate evidence for causality.
