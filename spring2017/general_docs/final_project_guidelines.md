# Guidelines for final project

## Presentation

Each student will have about 8 minutes to give an overview of their project. The style of this is not extremely formal. Think of it more as an elevator pitch. Tell us why you care about this topic, what reporting there has been on it, and what research has been done. Also tell us what problems/holes there are in the literature and how you think they could be rectified. This should come from the news articles and primary research papers you've been reading throughout your milestones.

You may want to leave a minute at the end of your presentation for a few questions or comments from the audience!

## Paper

**Part 1: synthesis of the current state of knowledge on your topic**

This section of the paper should be in essay form. Tie together your (1) summaries and (2) critiques of the 10 news articles and 3 research papers. Write as if for a moderately statistically savvy audience. Assume that the audience knows concepts such as hypothesis testing, linear regression, and logistic regression. Statistical concepts above this should be explained at a level as in your journal assignments and perhaps similar to this [linear regression example](http://news.mit.edu/2010/explained-reg-analysis-0316). Again, I emphasize that you should provide summaries as well as critiques of this reading material.

Please provide quotes from the original articles when appropriate. Provide a references section as a numbered list at the end of the paper. When you reference facts or provide quotations from these papers in the main text, provide a square bracket citation with the number of the article in the references section. For example:

"There has been considerable debate regarding the efficacy of bare metal stents in the elderly population [2]."

1. Smith, John. Title of article 1. Name of journal. 1999.
2. Smith, Jane. Title of article 2. Name of journal. 2003.

**Part 2: proposed data analysis**

If you are using an existing dataset, describe the dataset:

- What covariates were assessed?
- What is the quality of this data? Are there any sorts of errors or biases that could have arisen?
- Would you collect information on any more to supplement your analysis?

If you are proposing to collect your own data, describe what you would do to collect the data:

- What covariates would you collect information on? How would you collect the information? Databases, interviews, etc.
- What is the quality of this data? Are there any sorts of errors or biases that could arise? How would you try to minimize these errors?

Based on this data, describe your data analysis plan. You need to use one method that we learned about in modules 1 to 4. Feel free to use more (i.e. proposing a multi-faceted analysis). Come talk to me if you have questions about whether your method is appropriate.

- Describe why your plan is appropriate.
- Explain the underlying statistics concepts.
- Discuss any assumptions of your methods. This may tie into the data quality aspect above.
- Discuss how your proposed analysis would add to the body of knowledge on your topic.
