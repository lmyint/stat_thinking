# Module: Association Studies

## Class 1

### Post-class assignment

Based on discussions from class, comment on the following and how your interpretations before class have changed:

1. Death and illness due to severe avian flu formed the outcome in the influenza study. Comment on the following:
    - Why did the authors use severe cases as opposed to all cases of avian flu? What impact might this have on their results?
    - What problems could there be with counting avian flu infections and deaths?
2. The authors included several predictors in their models of death and illness due to severe avian flu. Regarding predictors, comment on the following:
    - Do you think there are other factors that could confound their results?
    - How well were these predictors measured/ascertained?
3. This study has provided some evidence that the strain of flu that people are first exposed to is associated with the risk of death or illness to severe avian flu. Further evaluate the conclusions of this study by commenting on the following:
    - Why must we be careful to say that an association rather than a cause was found?
    - Explain one basic science (laboratory) experiment that could futher substantiate the claims in this study
    - Explain one observational study that could further substantiate the claims in this study
