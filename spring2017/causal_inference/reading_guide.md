### Propensity scores

[Do preschool special education services make a difference in kindergarten reading and mathematics skills?: A propensity score weighting analysis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440512001112)

- What are propensity scores and what is being done in propensity score weighting to estimate the treatment effect?
- What treatment effect is being estimated: ATE, ATT, or something else? What is the interpretation of that treatment effect?
- How were the propensity scores estimated?
- What is meant by a "region of common support"? Why is this important in propensity score approaches? How did the authors address this?
- How was balance of covariates assessed? Why is this important?
- After the propensity scores were estimated, how were they used in subsequent analysis to estimate the treatment effect?
- How well do you think SUTVA holds in this study?

### Instrumental variables

[Evaluating short-term drug effects using a physician-specific prescribing preference as an instrumental variable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2715942/)

- What is the idea behind instrumental variable approaches? When are they used?
- What instruments were considered in this study? Are they strong or weak instruments?
- Do the instruments satisfy the assumptions outlined in lecture? What are these assumptions for?
- The authors estimate the treatment effect in 4 ways. Explain what is being done in each of these 4 methods. How do you expect the estimates to differ between these 4 approaches?
- How well do you think SUTVA holds in this study?
