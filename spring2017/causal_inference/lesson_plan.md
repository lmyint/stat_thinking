# Lesson plan: Causal Inference

## Class 1

Lecture

- Introduction to causal inference thinking
- Rubin's causal model
- Randomized controlled trials

Notes for lecture

- Barely had enough time to get to end of RD. Ideas for shortening follow
- Don't spend too long on Lord's paradox. Might be better to give the prompt as a pre-class reading assignment with a short response required on Blackboard.
- Too long on randomization mechanisms. Pre class reading

- Interrupted time series paper

Notes from discussion
