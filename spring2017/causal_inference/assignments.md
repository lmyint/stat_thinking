# Module: Causal Inference

For this module, there will be no assignments to turn in on Blackboard until Sunday, March 12. This assignment will be the only journal assignment for the module and address topics discussed in each class. You will have readings before each class to prepare for in-class discussions. The questions to address in the journal are at the end of this document.

## Pre-class assignments

### Class 1

Let's say that we wished to determine the effect of a gun policy on crime rates. This policy was adopted statewide in each of 10 states one year ago. Can we compare crime rates between these ten states and the other states that did not adopt the policy to determine if the gun policy causes a drop in violence? Why or why not?

After thinking about this question, watch the following [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrmrH26EhSo) for an introduction to an important model in the field of causal inference.

Read the following two articles:

- [The role for pragmatic randomized controlled trials (pRCTs) in comparative effectiveness research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22752634)
- [Revisiting Field Experimentation: Field Notes for the Future](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11928889)

### Class 2

We will be discussing matching methods and instrumental variables in class. For some background explanation, watch the following two videos:

- [An intuitive introduction to Propensity Score Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACVyPp1Fy6Y)
- [An intuitive introduction to Instrumental Variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ3d2syNfYI)

We will be having an in-class discussion and debate regarding the two articles below. Everyone should read both articles and come prepared to justify your assigned positions (below).

1. [Thimerosal and the Occurrence of Autism: Negative Ecological Evidence From Danish Population-Based Data](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/3/604)
2. [A Randomized Trial of Intraarterial Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411587)

We will be splitting into two groups to discuss these articles:

- Group 1 will defend the positions in article 1 and attack the positions in article 2.
- Group 2 will attack the positions in article 1 and defend the positions in article 2.

### Class 3

We will be having an in-class discussion and debate regarding the two articles below. Everyone should read both articles and come prepared to justify your assigned positions (below).

1. [Do preschool special education services make a difference in kindergarten reading and mathematics skills?: A propensity score weighting analysis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440512001112)
2. [Evaluating short-term drug effects using a physician-specific prescribing preference as an instrumental variable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2715942/)

We will be splitting into two groups to discuss these articles:

- Group 1 will defend the positions in article 1 and attack the positions in article 2.
- Group 2 will attack the positions in article 1 and defend the positions in article 2.

## Journal assignment

For each of the four research articles we read during class (listed below), describe how the study fits into the Rubin causal model. Specifically, define as precisely as possible

- Treatment
- Units
- Potential outcomes

Also discuss whether you think the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption is valid in each study. If the assumption might be violated, how would this affect the results of the study?

For each article, describe the study design used (e.g. randomized trial, interrupted time series) and the assumptions that each study design makes in order to get accurate estimates of causal effects. Are these assumptions met in each study? If any are violated, how would this affect the results of the study?

Research articles:

1. [Thimerosal and the Occurrence of Autism: Negative Ecological Evidence From Danish Population-Based Data](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/3/604)
2. [A Randomized Trial of Intraarterial Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411587)
3. [Do preschool special education services make a difference in kindergarten reading and mathematics skills?: A propensity score weighting analysis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440512001112)
4. [Evaluating short-term drug effects using a physician-specific prescribing preference as an instrumental variable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2715942/)
