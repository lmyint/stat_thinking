# Module: Survival Analysis

## Class 1

### Pre-class assignment

Read the following articles on duration of obesity and cancer risk:

1. [CNN: How much a decade of obesity raises your cancer risk](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/16/health/obesity-overweight-cancer-risk/)
2. [CBS news: Women's risk for 4 cancers goes up the more years spent overweight](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/womens-risk-for-4-cancers-goes-up-the-more-years-spent-overweight/)

Also read this [introduction to survival analysis concepts](https://www.cscu.cornell.edu/news/statnews/stnews78.pdf).

Provide brief answers to the following questions on Blackboard:

1. From just the news articles above, what is your overall impression of the novelty and believability of the main results? Are there things we should be optimistic about or worry about?
2. What are the key features of survival data that make specialized methods necessary for analysis? Provide an example of how these might come up in the above study on the relationship between obesity duration and cancer risk.
3. What do Kaplan-Meier curves estimate? Provide an example of how these might be used in the above study.
4. What is the Cox regression model useful for? Provide an example of it might be used in the above study.

## Class 2

### Pre-class assignment

Read the following [original research article](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002081) on obesity duration and cancer risk (also available on Blackboard). You will be divided into groups to present key material from different sections of the paper.

- Group 1: methods (data collection)
    - Discuss the methods used for enrollment and collection of information and measurements on the study participants
- Group 2: statistical analysis
    - Explain all statistical concepts in the statistical analysis section
- Group 3: results and discussion
    - Explain how to read and interpret the tables and figures in the paper
    - Comment on the implications, limitations, and reporting of the results

## Journal assignment: end of module

Perform a thorough evaluation of the [PLoS Medicine research article](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002081) on obesity duration and cancer risk. Evaluate the study design, data collection, statistical analysis, results, and conclustions. In your evaluation, also make sure to define and explain all statistical concepts.

Also answer these related questions:

1. Kaplan-Meier curves were not mentioned in the statistical analysis section. Given the goals of the study, explain why the authors used Cox regression instead. Explain some questions that the authors could have tried to answer with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests, but also comment on the limitations of this.
2. Suppose you wanted to further investigate the apparent implications of this study using by designing your own study in which you administer an intervention. What intervention would you use and what study design? If the claims made in this paper are indeed true, what results would you expect to see?
