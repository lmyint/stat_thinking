## Statistical methods in survival analysis

- Estimating the survival function
    - Kaplan-Meier estimation
- Comparing Kaplan-Meier curves
    - Log-rank tests and their variations
- Estimating the effect of covariates on survival outcomes
    - Parametric models of survival
    - Cox proportional hazards regression

## Notation and terminology

$T_i$: observed survival time for subject $i$ (random variable)
$\delta_i$: censoring indicator for subject $i$ (1 = censored, 0 = observed)

The probability distribution function for $T$ is $f(t)$, and the cumulative distribution function is $F(t) = P(T \geq t)$.

Ask class why I don't include censoring time.

## Functions of interest

Survivor function: probability of survival past a time $t$

$$ S(t) = P(T > t) = 1 - F(t) $$

Hazard function: instantaneous rate of failure at time $t$ given survival up to time $t$

$$ h(t) = \lim_{\delta t \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T < t+\delta t \mid T \geq t)}{\delta t} $$
