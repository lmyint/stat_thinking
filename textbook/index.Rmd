# Preface {-}

This is the class textbook for Statistical Thinking for Informed Decision Making. This book will serve as the source for pre-class reading on statistical concepts. Boxed sections within the book entitled **Respond on Blacboard:** should be answered and responses submitted on Blackboard before each class. Boxed sections entitled **Reflection Question** are for you to think about on your own, with no response needed on Blackboard. These will typically be a source of discussion during class.
