Let's say that we wished to determine the effect of a gun policy on crime rates. This policy was adopted statewide in each of 10 states one year ago. Can we compare crime rates between these ten states and the other states that did not adopt the policy to determine if the gun policy causes a drop in violence? Why or why not?
