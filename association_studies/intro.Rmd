## Association studies

How are various factors related to an outcome?

<div class="notes">
Emphasize the variability that manifests at every stage

## Research question in the press

How does influenza strain exposure in childhood affect the risk of being infected with and dsevere H5N1 or H7N9 in adulthood and its severity?

## Research question from initial investigation

Starts with an observation: unexplained difference in age distributions of two influenza A viruses (H5N1 and H7N9)

Why are older people more likely to be infected with one strain and younger people more likely to be infected with the other strain?

## Thought process

What are the characteristics of the older people (who tended to be infected with H7) and of the younger people (who tended to be infected with H5)?

What characteristics can we look at?

<div class="notes">
Prompt the class to think of characteristics that might explain this differential infection. Can include it in the assignment so that they are better prepared.

## Key domain-specific knowledge

Recent research suggests the existence of cross-immunity groups. Immunity to one subtype in a group seems to confer immunity to the other subtypes in the group.

    - Group 1: seasonal H1 and H2; avian H5
    - Group 2: seasonal H3; avian H7

This knowledge prompted the researchers to ask: does the subtype of an individual's first influenza exposure affect immunity to avian flus H5 and H7?

Does data on this exist?

What if the researchers had not known about this recent research?

## Points to evaluate

- Outcome
- Subjects
- Predictors
- Analysis
- Conclusions

## Outcome

- Is it continuous, binary, categorical? Answer determines what types of models can be fit
- How many outcomes are being studied?
- Ideal outcome or an outcome of convenience?

----

### Outcome variable type

Introduce GLMs

What type of variable is used to measure immunity?

----

### Number of outcomes

One approach to analyzing multiple outcomes is to combine them into a score.

When should a variable be a covariate and when should it define multiple levels over which to fit separate models?

## Study subjects

- How were subjects selected?
