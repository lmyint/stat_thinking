# Research question

## Research question in the press

How does influenza strain exposure in childhood affect the risk of being infected with and dsevere H5N1 or H7N9 in adulthood and its severity?

## Research question from initial investigation

From the Science editorial:

> This [hemagglutinin] difference parallels intriguing epidemiological differences: A/H5N1 cases are found mainly in children and young adults, whereas A/H7N9 cases areconcentrated in older individuals. These contrasting age profiles have sparked several hypotheses, including the effect of age-specific contacts with infected birds for A/H7N9 and previous immunity to the neuraminidase surface protein for A/H5N1.

Why are older people more likely to be infected with one strain and younger people more likely to be infected with the other strain?

## Thought process

What are the characteristics of the older people (who tended to be infected with H7) and of the younger people (who tended to be infected with H5)?

What characteristics can we look at?

<div class="notes">
Prompt the class to think of characteristics that might explain this differential infection. Write these on the board. These covariates are good candidates for variables that should be adjusted for in the statistical analysis. Prompt the students to recall the uses of regression.
</div>

## Key domain-specific knowledge

From the original Science paper:

> recent experiments have revealed that broadly protective immune responses can provide cross-immunity between different HA subtypes, particularly subtypes in the same phylogenetic group

Group 1: seasonal H1 and H2; avian H5
Group 2: seasonal H3; avian H7

This knowledge prompted the researchers to ask: does the subtype of an individual's first influenza exposure affect immunity to avian flus H5 and H7?

Does data on this exist?

<div class="notes">
What if the researchers had not known about this recent research?
</div>

# Data

## What would the data need to look like?

For studying immunity to H5:

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(id = 1:10, diedFromH5 = sample(c("died", "lived"), 10, replace = TRUE), firstFluExp = sample(c("H1", "H2", "H3"), 10, replace = TRUE))
df
```

But `firstFluExp` is not available...directly.

## What needed to be done?

From the Science editorial:

> Using historical influenza epidemiological records, Gostic et al. carefully reconstruct the susceptibility of each birth cohort based on the likelihood that their primary infection was with group 1 or 2 HA influenza

<div class="notes">
The CNN article doesn't give a lot of detail. It is almost always necessary to go back to the original study.
</div>

<div class="notes">
For the p_yci

- strain prevalence by year and country
- age-specific poultry exposure rates by year

y = calendar year in which H5 or H7 infection occurred
c = country
i = birth cohort (calendar year of birth)

p_yci = probability of {H5,H7} infection (death or fatality) for an individual who had that aforementioned avian flu infection in calendar year y, in country c, and was born in year i
- Outcome vector has length equal to the number of birth years represented in the data. D_yc has the same length and describes the proportion of people born in each of those years (sum(D_yc)=1). Had poultry exposure rates by age group, so this would also form a vector of the same length
- For y,c in calendar_year_of_avian_flu_infection,country: fit multinomial model:
birth_year(i) num_H5_infects(outcome) demography poultry_exposure age_risk frac_HA_imprint frac_NA_imprint

# Data | <span style="text-decoration: underline">**outcome**</span>, study subjects, predictors

## Points to evaluate

- Ideal outcome or an outcome of convenience?
- Natural outcome or one artificially created by the researchers?
- Is there a chance that the outcome was ascertained with error?
- How many outcomes are being studied?

## Choice of outcome studied

> Next, the researchers collected data on more recent **clinical and fatal cases of H5N1 and H7N9**, two types of bird flu. They took a close look at each reported patient's age in the data -- and analyzed the more recent data along with the historical data.
> "We've done the analysis on H5 and H7 viruses because those are the ones that have caused lots of cases -- enough cases that we can do the statistics"

<div class="notes">
So really they were studying the relationship between immunity to **extreme** H5/H7 and first influenza exposure.
</div>

----

How might conclusions have been different if the authors also had information about non-severe cases of avian flu?

<div class="notes">
Consider different situations:
- Non-severe cases show the same effect as severe cases. This likely would have made the effect more precise. Why? Higher sample size
- Non-severe cases don't show the same effect as severe cases. This would have diminished the effect size
</div>

## Choice of outcome studied

- Data for some types of outcomes are more readily availble than others
    - Medical information: physician diagnosis rather than patient report
    - Extreme events rather than more typical ones
- When there are many adjectives describing an outcome, think carefully about the generalizability of the results.
- Somtimes researchers create categories for their outcome
    - Thresholding a continuous variable
    - Summarizing a complex occurrence as a categorical event

## Outcome ascertainment

???

## Outcome ascertainment

Systematic inaccuracies in measuring the outcome can bias affect estimates.

- Did outcome ascertainment require subjects to rely on memory? (recall bias)
- What are the accuracy characteristics of the technologies measuring the outcomes?
- How complete/accurate is the historical data being used to obtain outcomes?

What inaccuracies might be associated with measuring the number of severe avian flu cases?

## Number of outcomes

Sometimes researchers collect multiple outcomes on each subject (e.g. physical and cognitive)

- Separate regression analysis for each one
- If a more abstract measure is being studied, one approach to analyzing multiple outcomes is to combine them into a score
    - e.g. Want to study patient understanding of insurance procedures. Questions on a patient survey could be viewed as multiple outcomes

# Data | outcome, <span style="text-decoration: underline">**study subjects**</span>, predictors

## Points to evaluate

How were subjects selected?

- Was the study observational or randomized?
- Enrollment criteria

If there is bias in the type of people who end up in the study, we need to think carefully about both the outcomes and predictors represented in our study.

<div class="notes">
We can try to
- limit the generalizability we perceive
- create a lower or upper bound on the overall effect
Create a lower or upper bound on the overall effect: if most people who enroll are extremely sick, we might guess that the effect is at most what is reported
</div>

# Data | outcome, study subjects, <span style="text-decoration: underline">**predictors**</span>

## Points to evaluate

- Were all important predictors measured/collected?
- How well are the predictors measured/ascertained?

## Predictor ascertainment

> In order to examine whether childhood exposure influences immunity later in life, the researchers collected data from historical epidemiological records on all known human cases of these virus subtypes and estimated the annual probability of infection in children from around the world.

## Model specification

Recall that one of the assumptions of regression was correct model specification

# Analysis

## Points to evaluate

- Identify the statistical method(s) used and the associated assumptions
    - Often not possible from media reporting
- Are there any features of the data that lead you to question the validity of those assumptions?

# Conclusions

## Points to evaluate

- What estimates are reported? Do they have associated measures of uncertainty?
- How useful are the conclusions? To whom are they useful?
- Are appropriate reference/control conditions provided to give context for what we should expect?

## Reported estimates

From CNN:

> If you were exposed to a certain flu strain in your childhood, that first exposure could have resulted in long-term protection against related flu viruses, reducing your risk of a future severe infection by up to 75%

## Reported estimates

From the original research paper:

> ?????

## Conclusions {.build}

Are the conclusions something we should care about?

Example: reports about movie earnings at the box office. Can we compare earnings from movies made in different years?
