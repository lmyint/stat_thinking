# Module: Association Studies

## Class 1

### Pre-class assignment

Read [this CNN article on flu risk](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/health/flu-risk-birth-year/) and the [associated Science editorial](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/354/6313/706.full.pdf). Answer the following and explain your thinking:

1. Research question
    - What was the main research question as presented in the CNN article? As presented in the Science editorial?
2. Data
    - What information can you obtain about the source of the data for the study from the CNN article? From the Science editorial?
    - Can you judge the quality of the data? Think about what different measurements might have been collected and what errors they might be subject to.
3. Analysis
    - Does the CNN article provide information on what statistical analysis was used? What about the Science editorial?
4. Conclusions
    - What conclusions are reported in both the CNN article and Science editorial?
    - Are there any associated measures of uncertainty?
    - Do the conclusions seem believable to you?
    - For what population are these results useful? (i.e. Are these results useful to the entire world? Just to Asia?)
5. Writing/reporting
    - Does the CNN article do a good job capturing the information in the editorial?
    - Is there any useful information left out of the CNN article?

The [original paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/354/6313/722.full.pdf) and [supplemental information](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2016/11/09/354.6313.722.DC1/aag1322_Gostic_SM.pdf) are not required to read, but we will go over selected material in these sources during class.

### Post-class assignment

Based on discussions from class, comment on the following:

1. The authors used historical records to estimate the fraction of each birth-year cohort whose first influenza A virus exposure was to H1, H2, or H3 and the fraction unexposed to influenza A. What are the pros and cons of using such data? Do you think this was appropriate?
2. What data was used to link patterns of first exposure to patterns of modern day avian flu (H5 and H7) illness? Do you think this was appropriate?
3. Comment on the conclusions presented in the CNN article. What are the public health implications?
