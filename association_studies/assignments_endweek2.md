# Module: Association Studies

## Class 4

### Pre-class reading

#### Overview

For class on Thursday, we will be splitting into 4 groups to debate literature on two topics. Groups 1 and 2 will be responsible for reading in detail two studies on the association between vaccination and autism risk. Groups 3 and 4 will be responsible for reading in detail two studies on the association between Zika virus exposure in pregnant women and birth defects. Groups 1 and 3 will argue the side that the studies provide evidence for the association. Groups 2 and 4 will argue the side that the studies do not provide evidence for the association.

For the topic to which your group was not assigned, be sure to at least read the abstracts for those articles carefully to be prepared for class discussion.

#### Vaccination and autism

In a [1998 Lancet article](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract), Andrew Wakefield and colleagues proposed an association between MMR vaccination and developmental disorders - autism spectrum disorder in particular. Although it was later found that the data in this study were falsified and the study retracted, this original article launched a public scare regarding the safety of vaccines.

One hypothesis is that Thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound used to preserve vaccines, affects autism risk. Read the following two articles studying the association between mercury/Thimerosal exposure and autism risk and be prepared to argue your side on Thursday. Articles are available on Blackboard.

- [Prenatal and Infant Exposure to Thimerosal From Vaccines and Immunoglobulins and Risk of Autism](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2010/09/13/peds.2010-0309.full.pdf)
    - [CDC's webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/study-risk-autism.html) on this study
- [Thimerosal exposure in infants and neurodevelopmental disorders: An assessment of computerized medical records in the Vaccine Safety Datalink](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2008.04.002)

#### Zika and birth defects

The Zika virus has made a splash in the news, particularly because of the 2016 Olympics in Brazil. Researchers have reported [increased risk of birth deformations](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/26/well/family/doctors-brace-for-zika-babies.html) such as microcephaly in pregnant women exposed to the Zika virus. Read the following two articles studying this association and be prepared to argue your side on Thursday. Articles are available on Blackboard.

- [Birth Defects Among Fetuses and Infants of US Women With Evidence of Possible Zika Virus Infection During Pregnancy](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2593702)
- [Zika Virus Infection in Pregnant Women in Rio de Janeiro](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602412)

### Post-class assignment

Based on class discussions of the articles above, evaluate the evidence set forth for the association between vaccination and autism risk and for the association between Zika virus exposure and birth defects. For each topic, discuss the following in paragraph form:

1. What was the specific scientific question addressed by the article? How does this question fit into the general debate on the topic?
2. What data was used to answer the question? Is it reliable?
3. What methods were used to analyze the data? Were they appropriate?
4. Does this study provide evidence for the association?
