# Module: Association Studies

## Class 1

### Pre-class assignment

Read [this CNN article on flu risk](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/health/flu-risk-birth-year/) and the [associated Science editorial](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/354/6313/706.full.pdf). Answer the following in well-written paragraphs:

1. What was the main research question?
2. What data was used to answer the question?
3. What conclusions were reported?
4. Comment on why these conclusions seem believable to you or not. Is there information absent from the article that would have been useful in helping you decide?
5. Comment on the utility of these conclusions. To whom are they useful and to what extent?
6. Does the CNN article do a good job capturing the information in the editorial?

The [original paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/354/6313/722.full.pdf) and [supplemental information](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2016/11/09/354.6313.722.DC1/aag1322_Gostic_SM.pdf) are not required to read, but we will go over material in these sources during class.

### Post-class assignment

Based on discussions from class, comment on the following:

1. The authors used historical records to estimate the fraction of each birth-year cohort whose first influenza A virus exposure was to H1, H2, or H3 and the fraction unexposed to influenza A. What are the pros and cons of using such data? Do you think this was appropriate?
2. What data was used to link patterns of first exposure to patterns of modern day avian flu (H5 and H7) illness? Do you think this was appropriate?
3. Comment on the conclusions presented in the CNN article. What are the public health implications?
