Read [this CNN article on flu risk](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/health/flu-risk-birth-year/) and the [associated Science editorial](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/354/6313/706.full.pdf). Answer the following in well-written paragraphs:

1. What was the main research question?
2. What data was used to answer the question?
3. What conclusions were reported?
4. Comment on why these conclusions seem believable to you or not. Is there information absent from the article that would have been useful in helping you decide?
5. Comment on the utility of these conclusions. To whom are they useful and to what extent?
6. Does the CNN article do a good job capturing the information in the editorial?

The [original paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/354/6313/722.full.pdf) and [supplemental information](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2016/11/09/354.6313.722.DC1/aag1322_Gostic_SM.pdf) are not required to read, but we will go over material in these sources during class.
