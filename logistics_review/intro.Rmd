## From research to media

[Scientific Studies: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw)

## Points from the video

Scientific studies may be subtly biased because scientists feel pressured to come up with eye-catch positive results

This is known as **publication bias**.

## Points from the video

It is possible to tweak your study and analysis to get the desired results:

- Adjust length of the study
- Collect a sample that is too small to be reliable
- "p-hacking": fiddling with your modeling approach to get a statistically significant result
    - [Interactive demo on FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/)
    - [Research article: The Extent and Consequences of P-Hacking in Science](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106)

## Points from the video

Even well-designed studies can give incorrect results

- We protect against the impact of this with replication studies
- It is never one study that proves an idea. Evidence 
    - [How do we know that smoking causes cancer?](http://www.cancer.org/latest-news/the-study-that-helped-spur-the-us-stop-smoking-movement.html)
- "There's no Nobel prize for fact checking"
    - With the way science is set up now, replication studies are not incentivized

## Points from the video

Original research is often distorted by the time we hear about it

- Press releases can exaggerate findings of a study
- Translating results on animal models to conclusions for humans
- Even though there may be disagreement in the scientific literature, the media reports on a study with exciting results and doesn't give context about the state of the literature

<div class="notes">
"A new study says..." - we should have ready in the back of our minds: "Yes, but are there other related studies that say the same thing?"

What happens if news agencies report just based on press release contents?

What factors might contribute to what authors write in press releases and what journalists take from press releases to put in an article?
</div>

## Points from the video

Part of the blame may be on us, the news consumers

- It's more interesting to read about something unexpected

Scientists and journalists don't always do a good job of framing expectations

- "Anyone is more open to anything when they're not hungry"
- Idea of having a control

## Points from the video

Statistical issues

- Low sample sizes make for unreliable estimates

Conflict of interest

- If a company funds certain research, we should be wary of ulterior motives

## Statistical thinking

Thinking like a scientist about to conduct a study

- Acknowledging the pitfalls at every stage of the study

Being aware of statistical ideas to know what methods are appropriate and why

- Our interest is usually in estimating effects. Estimation falls under the realm of statistics.
- What assumptions do we make when using different methods? Are they reasonable?
- Many different ways to analyze data. Want to be able to defend our approach(es).

## Course structure: class sessions

Organized into modules that are either 1 or 2 weeks long. Each module will focus on one field within statistics

1 week modules

- Introduction to a particular field of statistics
- Survey of statistical methods

2 week modules

- Class 1: Introduction to the field. Discussion of news articles
- Class 2: Survey of statistical methods used in this field
- Class 3: Simulation work in R to understand statistical methods and analysis choices
- Class 4: Student-led discussions of news articles related to this field
    - Dicussions should tie in topics covered in classes 1-3
    - Typically 2-3 sets of articles. Each set is covered by one group of students

<div>
Think about when the students should read the primary research article. Before class 2 - they will be confused. After 2, when will we go over it? If before 2, I need to add lecture material in class 1 so that they will be able to get through it.
